  abstract = 	 {Value functions are a core component of reinforcement learning. The main idea is to to construct a single function approximator V(s; theta) that estimates the long-term reward from any state s, using parameters θ. In this paper we introduce universal value function approximators (UVFAs) V(s,g;theta) that generalise not just over states s but also over goals g. We develop an efficient technique for supervised learning of UVFAs, by factoring observed values into separate embedding vectors for state and goal, and then learning a mapping from s and g to these factored embedding vectors. We show how this technique may be incorporated into a reinforcement learning algorithm that updates the UVFA solely from observed rewards. Finally, we demonstrate that a UVFA can successfully generalise to previously unseen goals.}

  abstract = {This standard textbook of modern graph theory, now in its fifth edition, combines the authority of a classic with the engaging freshness of style that is the hallmark of active mathematics. It covers the core material of the subject with concise yet reliably complete proofs, while offering glimpses of more advanced methods in each field by one or two deeper results, again with proofs given in full detail. The book can be used as a reliable text for an introductory course, as a graduate text, and for self-study. From the reviews: This outstanding book cannot be substituted with any other book on the present textbook market. It has every chance of becoming the standard textbook for graph theory. Acta Scientiarum Mathematiciarum Deep, clear, wonderful. This is a serious book about the heart of graph theory. It has depth and integrity. Persi Diaconis \& Ron Graham, SIAM Review The book has received a very enthusiastic reception, which it amply deserves. A masterly elucidation of modern graph theory. Bulletin of the Institute of Combinatorics and its Applications Succeeds dramatically ... a hell of a good book. MAA Reviews A highlight of the book is what is by far the best account in print of the Seymour-Robertson theory of graph minors. Mathematika ... like listening to someone explain mathematics.
